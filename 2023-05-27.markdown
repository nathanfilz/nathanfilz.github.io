# The Day the World Went Nuts

**08:00**

  I turned on my tv to catch the morning news, but as I did, my local NBC station was interrupted by a shrill siren followed by a long pause. (Shit, dead air on broadcast tv is never a good sign) The screen cut to a shot of the president sitting at the resolute desk, but something was wrong, the background was dark, but anyone with a pair of eyes could tell that they were not in the familiar Oval Office. The bald eagle rug was gone, there were no photos of deceased presidents, no windows overlooking the white house lawn, it was cold and empty.  

  "My Fellow Americans" drifted out through the tv speakers.
  
  It sounded like shit, as if the microphone he was speaking into was attached to an old E-Machines All-in-One. 
  
  Another bad sign.

  "The vice president has just resigned. After the abduction of the majority of my cabinet, 520 members of congress, as well as roughly 1/3 of the american population, he no longer felt as though he would be able to fufill the duties of President of the United States in the event that I am unable to do so. Seeing as the invaders have made it clear that my head is a non-negotionale concession this planet will have to make, this presents a significant problem. 

  We will therefor be holding open auditions for the role on Tuesday in the basement of St. Glorks Presbeterian in downtown DC. We hope to see you all there"
